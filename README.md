# languange
## 1. OC -> Swift.
### Swift has more morden languange features include:
* `Closures` unified with function pointers
* `Tuples` and `multiple` return values Generics
* Fast and concise `iteration` over a `range` or `collection`
* `Structs` that support `methods`, `extensions`, and `protocols`
* `Functional` programming patterns, e.g. `map` and `filter`
* Powerful `error handling` built-in
* Advanced control flow with `do`, `guard`, `defer`, and `repeat` keywords
* simple three-character keywords define a variable (`var`) or constant (`let`).
*  default Swift objects can never be `nil`, and trying to make or use a `nil` object will results in a compile-time error. 

## 2. If upgrade to swift. What our project should change.
#### I think it will be called the refactoring project.The follows should be done.
* Main frame based on UI.
* Data Logic devide from UI. ` MVVM`
* Local storage `Core Data. FFDB. Model`
* Project engineering `More reuse model. more extract`
* Documet writting. I prefer advice to create a svn storage to commulicate document about `server api` and `UI design`. and each one's `Project structure explain`

## 3. How long it will take.

If follow `2` technical implementation.	code refactoring atleast need `four` month. and during the refactoring. Old OC project still need maintenance. till complete the refactoring. and then replace with new project. This will be `put things right once and for all`
